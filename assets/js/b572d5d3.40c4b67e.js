After some long time like 20 days, I was able to come up with a solution which could solve the problem. I had created my first pull request for that problem, searched for another issue and started working on it right away. The second issue I claimed was to add a new flag for the documentation generation. After started to work on it, for my surprise, my first issue was still hanging and I was still figuring a way to work on it. I had been trying to solve both the issues and after some long days, I was able to send a pull request for my second issue too. But, they were still not approved and merged. I had been asking questions and getting clarifications on the defaults and the tests. Later after trying a lot, my second issue got merged before my first issue got merged. I was very happy to see the code I have contributed present in their source code. The feeling was very good when I solved some problem (it may be even small issue) and see my code there.

But, I still wanted to stick on to this project as this might give me an experience on how and where my limits were. I wanted to step out of my comfort zone and started trying my best to know about the performance of the languages, comparing them with chapel and also have read a few papers based on them. It was a confusing topic for me to choose and I was not sure at the beginning that I would be able to crack it. I had slowed down my contributions to the chapel and put my focus on preparing the project proposal. After working for months, I was able to finish my proposal with few implementations in my mind and a few of the different benchmarks of the languages. This was when I got confidence that I will surely be selected to work on this project this year. I was eagerly waiting for the results to come out, it was a 50:50 chance for me to get selected, but, in the end after the results came out, I was not selected for the Google Summer of Code programme. I was not worried that I was not selected instead felt happy for all the contributions I did gave me a lot of knowledge and a lot of experience which I couldn't get before.
